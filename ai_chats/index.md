# Use of AI in This Project

<!-- Introduction -->

Throughout this project, I used **AI (ChatGPT-5, the current flagship model)** mainly to **speed up development, improve code quality, and assist in debugging**.  
The AI was not used to write the entire project but rather as a **coding assistant** to enhance productivity and maintain high-quality standards across the codebase.

## How AI Was Used

<!-- Section describing main use cases -->

- **Code Refactoring and Optimization:**  
  ChatGPT helped refactor large or repetitive sections of code to make them more modular, readable, and efficient. It also suggested cleaner logic or naming conventions.

- **Improving Comments and Documentation:**  
  I used ChatGPT to rewrite or expand comments, ensuring that complex functions and classes were well documented.

- **Database Migration Assistance:**  
  While working on database schema changes, ChatGPT assisted in modifying migration files, updating column types, and renaming or restructuring tables safely.

- **Debugging and Error Analysis:**  
  The AI was especially helpful in analyzing long stack traces or exception logs, summarizing them into concise explanations, and identifying likely root causes.

- **General Productivity:**  
  For repetitive edits such as updating function signatures, renaming variables, or improving formatting, ChatGPT made the process significantly faster.

## Example Prompts Given to ChatGPT

<!-- Practical examples of prompts used during development -->

Here are some example prompts that reflect how I used ChatGPT during development:

1. **Code Refactoring**

   ```
   Please refactor this Java class to improve readability and follow best practices. Keep the logic the same but simplify the control flow.
   ```

2. **Improving Comments and Readability**

   ```
   Add clear and professional comments to this function explaining what each step does. Avoid redundant or obvious comments.
   ```

3. **Debugging / Error Analysis**

   ```
   Here’s the full stack trace from my Quarkus test. Can you summarize what’s going wrong and which part of the code is likely causing it?
   ```

   ```
   These are multiple errors from the terminal. Please summarize what the root issue is and what file I should check first.
   ```

4. **Improving Code Quality**

   ```
   Can you review this file and suggest improvements for performance or structure, without changing the core functionality?
   ```

5. **Summarizing Exceptions**
   ```
   This error message is very long — summarize it and tell me which SQL constraint or query might be causing it.
   ```

## Summary

<!-- Conclusion section -->

Overall, **ChatGPT-5 acted as a development co-pilot**, helping me focus on logic and architecture while offloading time-consuming tasks such as refactoring, debugging, and documentation.  
This led to **faster development cycles**, **cleaner code**, and **better maintainability** throughout the project.
